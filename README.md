The aim of this project was to create a software rasterizer and to learn about what the rasterization process is and how it is handled internally on the GPU.

Next to handling the rasterization process, the project also aimed in learning how to maintain a solid and proper architecture for clear data ownership. The architecture requirement wasn't only used for rasterization where mesh and material data should have clear ownerships for proper rasterization, but also for the creation of a basic scenegraph where a child and parent node hierarchy was mandatory.
